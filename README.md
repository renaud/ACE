# What is ACE?

ACE stands for Automated Coordinate Extraction. It's a Python package for automated extraction of functional MRI activation data from the tables of published neuroimaging articles. ACE is actually ACE2; a long, long time ago in a faraway land there was a clunkier Ruby version of ACE that did more or less the same thing much more poorly. Thankfully, Ruby ACE has now been disappeared from the internets forever, leaving us with the slightly better thought out package you see here.

## Installation

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed (see requirements.txt), e.g.

	> pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the package from source:

	> python setup.py install

That's all!

## Usage

For now, take a look at the tests to get a sense of how things work. A quickstart guide will fill this space in the near future.
